**Hi üëã I'm Zakariaa Oulhafiane, and I am 29 years old.**  
**I am passionate about Linux and open-source technologies.**

This is my story of discovering this beautiful world of technology:

- üî≠ **2008-2012** : I watched a movie called Hackers, and that was the beginning of everything, after watching it I googled how to hack an MSN/Skyblog, after few weeks I was able to understand a method named **Fake Page** that you have to create a mirror of the target website then add a script to it to send you The Email/Pass and then send it to whoever you want to steal their credentials, I was very happy by practicing this method with my best friends and showing them the method (**Note: I didn't steal anyone's password**), then after a while I started to learn **how can i hack a computer ?** then I found out what **Trojans** could do, that time it was two famous rats called **PRORAT and Bifrost**, I tried them both in the same network and everything works fine, I tried them with my friend's computer not in the same network, it failed, then I discovered something called **Reverse Connection** to let the rat when loaded in the victim machine to start the connection to my computer and also I was required to open a port on my home router, and it works after several days of trying, after I asked myself a question : how can I hide these trojans from **Antivirus**, then I started the new journey of using **Hex Editor** to check what are the bytes captured by the antivirus, then changing them, after a while **I joined a Hacking team** and we did bad things like changing the index of a hacked site by our index.html Saying Hacked By ... and registering it in in **zone-h.org** üòÖ.  
  I remember how excited I was during those years and how many nights I didn't sleep discovering **exploits** posted on **milw0rm.com** and trying to figure them out without any programming knowledge ü§î.

- üå± **2012-2015** : After the past years, I had a lot of difficulty using tools and understanding exploits, so I decided that I had to learn how to create a program or **how can I create my own shell** (because I was using other people's shells **r57, c99** and a lot of them are injected), so I started with PHP, because that's the language I saw in all the scripts I use for hacking üòÑ, I learned the basics of programming (if/else, for, while, functions), then I joined a programming school, we learned C and basic algorithms by doing a lot of exercises and i was good at everything, then JAVA, but I quit school after a while, to be honest with you I was enthusiastic by hacking, so i left to focus on it , but this time with programming skills, I was able to create a lot of tools, to better understand the exploits, and linux commands.

- ü§î **2015-2017** : After years of messing around, I decided to go back to school and build a career, and I was good at programming but really bad at design (user interface) ü§£, I got first grade in both years of study, I learned C, C#, object-oriented programming (OOP), event-driven programming, SQL Server, ASP.NET.  

  **Projects** : 
   - [SQL Server 1](https://github.com/oulhafiane/my-reports/blob/master/Syst%C3%A8me-de-Gestion-de-Bases-de-Donn%C3%A9es-Relationnelles-1.pdf).  
   - [SQL Server 2](https://github.com/oulhafiane/my-reports/blob/master/Syst%C3%A8me-de-Gestion-de-Bases-de-Donn%C3%A9es-Relationnelles-2.pdf).  
   - [Development of a search engine for keywords on social networks : Facebook/Twitter](https://github.com/oulhafiane/my-reports/blob/master/Rapport-De-Stage-Blue_Fountain.pdf).

   - [Android game FacePool: Like billiards but with another style, online game](https://github.com/oulhafiane/my-reports/blob/master/facepool.pdf).   

- ‚ù§Ô∏è **2017-2018** : I got married, after getting my diploma I created a company [OULMANET](https://charika.ma/societe-oulmanet-734218) S.A.R.L.A.U.  
  
  **Projects** :  
   - Development of server-side home automation applications using Arduino and Raspberry PI (Language C).  
   - Development of client-side home automation applications for Android & IOS using Apache Cordova.  
   - Creation of web and mobile applications (PHP, MySql, JAVA (Android), React-Native).  

- üí° **2018-2019** : God blessed me with the arrival of my sweet princess Amira üë∂üèª, and a new coding school opened in our country part of [42Network](https://twitter.com/42Network) called [1337](https://twitter.com/1337FIL).  
  I joined the school after a one month of competition called [POOL](https://github.com/oulhafiane/1337-42-Pool), i got accepted, that's when everything changed 180¬∞, from my mindset to my skills.  
  I discovered that I didn't know anything about programming (a metaphor), especially the C language ü§£ü§£.  
  I choose the **System/Unix/Shells** branch because if you remember at the beginning the question I was asking myself how can I create my own shell üòÑ.  
  After 8 months of studying **Linux Commands/Shell/FileSystem/System Calls/Terminal Capabilities/Deep C Language** I successfully made two shells [Minishell](https://github.com/oulhafiane/1337-42-minishell) , [21sh](https://github.com/oulhafiane/1337-42-21sh), and contributed to [42sh](https://github.com/karimstm/42sh).

- üìà **2019-2020** : I reached the internship project in my curriculum, then I joined UM6P for a 6-month internship.  
    Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoI36nmzWmo&feature=youtu.be) I explain the project I worked on.  
  
  **About The Project** :
    We made a Prototype for a platform used to bring scientists and their research together like a blog for them to post their idea, and give feedback to others,
    and also it helps them in their research by giving them necessary tools to collect, cleanse, visualize and analyze data.

- üò∑ **2020(Corona)** : The school was closed for 7 months, the store of my father and his partner had gone bankrupt, and they were about to sell it, then I bought his partner's share (50%) [SAZALUM](https://charika.ma/societe-sazalum-493799), then after the curfew (3 months), I built and relaunched the shop with my father, and it was done successfully ü§ë.

- ‚òÄÔ∏è **2021-Current Time** : The school reopened, I came back full of energy to discover the world of **Kernel/FileSystem/Drivers**, that's why I choose two branches to work on in my curriculum: **Kernel Branch** and **DevOps Branch**, devops for me is a new world, I just discovered it and I want to learn a lot from this world, so far I discovered the great tool that I really liked **Docker** because it uses something called **cgroups/namespaces** introduced in **kernel v2.6** and I want to learn a lot about those features, I also learned a bit about tools: **Kubernetes**, **Vagrant** , **Ansible**, and I'm on my way to discover everything in this world üåé.
