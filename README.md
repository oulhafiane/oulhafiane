**Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zakariaa Oulhafiane, and I am 29 years old.**  
**I am passionate about Linux and open-source technologies.**

This is my story of discovering this beautiful world of technology:

- ðŸ”­ **2008-2012** : I watched a movie called Hackers, and that was the beginning of everything, after watching it I googled how to hack an MSN/Skyblog, after few weeks I was able to understand a method named **Fake Page** that you have to create a mirror of the target website then add a script to it to send you The Email/Pass and then send it to whoever you want to steal their credentials, I was very happy by practicing this method with my best friends and showing them the method (**Note: I didn't steal anyone's password**), then after a while i started to learn **how can i hack a computer ?** then i found out what **Trojans** could do, that time it was two famous rats called **PRORAT and Bifrost**, i tried them both in the same network and everything works fine, i tried them with my friend's computer not in the same network, it failed, then i discovered something called **Reverse Connection** to let the rat when loaded in the vicim machine to start the connection to my computer and also i was required to open a port on my home router, and it works after several days of trying, after i asked myself a question : how can i hide these trojans from **Antivirus**, then i started the new journey of using **Hex Editor** to check what are the bytes captured by the antivirus, then changing them, after a while **i joined a Hacking team** and we did bad things like changing the index of a hacked site by our index.html Saying Hacked By ... and registering it in in **zone-h.org** ðŸ˜….  
  I remember how excited I was during those years and how many nights I didn't sleep discovering **exploits** posted on **milw0rm.com** and trying to figure them out without any programming knowledge ðŸ¤”.
